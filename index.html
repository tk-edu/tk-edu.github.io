                <span style="font-size: 70px;">s</span>o much has been said about in our lives about the 
                supposed dichotomy between dazing off, and getting <i>real work</i> done. But is there always 
                such a distinction? Could there even be some benefits to letting our minds wander? In the past,
                mind wandering has been shown to have a negative effect on various cognitive tasks<sup><a href="#ref1" style="text-decoration: none;">1</a></sup>.
                New research in the last few years may suggest that perhaps one domain in which it may 
                be helpful to lose focus is musical improvisation.

                In their study, researchers Palhares, Branco, and Gonçalves investigated the difference between
                musical creativity when performers reported they were "on-task," versus when they were allowing 
                their minds to wander freely during the performance. Specifically, participants were all instructed
                to improvise over given (<em>jazzy</em>) chord progressions. "Musical creativity" was measured by two 
                "expert musicians" who later judged recordings of the participants' performance using a quantative scale.
                In the end, the results indicated that musicians spent most of their time performing giving their
                playing "on-task attention," with mind wandering actually being somewhat rare. During these brief periods
                of mind wandering, however, an increase in measured musical creativity was observed. These results seem to
                suggest that the hypothesized benefit of mind wandering may actually benefit improvisational musical performance.

                Perhaps it has something to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flow state</a>.
                Perhaps it's the result of muscle memory moving a performer's hands and feet without their own input. It might be
                a result of a more relaxed state in which performers are less susceptible to self-imposed restraints<sup><a href="#ref1" style="text-decoration: none;">1</a></sup>.
                Whatever future research discovers about these findings, it seems that even though a musician's mind may wander off,
                we shouldn't forget that the music sometimes has a mind of its own.
